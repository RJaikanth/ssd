Matching Strategy (Loss Calculation) - 
    - For each ground truth box we are selecting from default boxes that vary over location,
      aspect ratio and scale
    - Start by matching ground truth box to the default box with the best IoU metric.
    - Then we match default boxes to any ground truth with IoU > 0.5


Loss Function - 
    - Weighted sum of Confidence Loss (Softmax loss) and Regression Loss (L1Loss)


Choosing Scales and aspect ratios for default boxes - 
    - scale_k = 0.2 + ((0.9 - 0.2)*(k - 1)) / (m - 1)
    where, 
        k = [1, m]
        m = Number of feature maps.


    - Aspect Ratios - 
        ar = [1, 2, 3, (1/2), (1/3)]
        width = scale_k * sqrt(ar)
        height = scale_k * sqrt(ar) 

        For aspect ratio of 1 we also add a default box whose scale is 
        sqrt(scale_k*scale_(k+1))
