1. Multi-scale feature maps for detection -
    - Convolutional layers at the end of the base network
    - These layers decrease in size progressively and allow predoctions at multiple scales
    - Model for predicting detections is different for each feature layer.

2. Convolutional predictors for detection -
    - Each layer produces a fixed set of predictions using a set of convolutional features
    - For a feature layer of size (m x n) with p channels, the basic element for predicting
      parameters of a potential detection is a (3x3xp) smallerkernel that produces either a
      score for a category, or a shape offset relative to default box coordinates.
    - At each ofthe (m * n) where the smaller (3x3xp) kernel is applies, it porduces an outout value.
      The bounding box offset output values are measured relative to a default box position (anchor box)
      relative to each feature map location.

3. Default boxes and aspect ratios - 
    - Associate a set of bounding boxes for each feature map cell, for multiple feature maps at the top of the network.
    - The default boxes tile the feature map in convolutional manner. At each feature map cell, we predict the offsets 
      relative to the default box shapes in the cell, as well as the per-class scores that indicate the presence of a
      class instance in each of those boxes.
    - For each box out of a total k boxes, we compute 'c' class scores and 4 offset positions.
      This results in (c+4)*k filters that are applied around each location in the feature map.
      This yields a (c+4)*k*m*n outputs for a m*n feature map.
