Architecture - 
    - Base Model
    - Several MultiScale Feature Blocks connected in a series    

Base Model - 
    - Modified VGG16 Model 
    - We do not use the FC layers from the VGG model. 
      Instead we use 2 conv layers that capture the feature maps of the model
    - We use the activated output from conv4_3 and conv_7 as one of the feature maps
      to capture the detections. 
    - After the base model, we will use MultiScale Feature Blocks to extract more 
      detections at different image sizes. 


MultiScale Feature Blocks - 
    - Nothing but a collection of 8 additional convolution layers in 4 blocks.
    - We collect the activated outputs from the 2nd layer of each block to add to the detections
    - These layers decrease the size of the feature maps slowly.


Why multiple scale feature maps??
    1. It increases number of detections for each class. (THIS!)
    2. Easier to detect smaller objects.
    3. More robust model.
